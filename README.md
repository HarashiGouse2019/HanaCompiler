HanaCompiler

The HanaCompiler is a compiler that supports the Hana Scripting Language (formally known as DSL, "Dialogue Scripting Language").
The compiler can handle logic within a game, and can also handle .d files that are more story driven. In order to do something like
functions and other logic in the game, you usually create a .ha file, and right you're logic there. Both the .ha and .d must reference each other in order
to take full advantage of the Hana Scripting Language
